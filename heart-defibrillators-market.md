<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heart Defibrillators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator</li><li>External Defibrillator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The heart defibrillator market comprises two primary types: Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs) and External Defibrillators. ICDs are surgically implanted devices that continuously monitor heart rhythms and deliver shocks when arrhythmias occur, primarily addressing severe cases of cardiac arrest. In contrast, External Defibrillators, which include Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) and manual devices used by medical professionals, are portable units designed for emergency use to restore normal heart rhythm during acute cardiac events. Both types play critical roles in improving survival rates and enhancing cardiac care.</p></p>
