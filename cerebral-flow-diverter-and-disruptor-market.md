<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cerebral Flow Diverter and Disruptor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flow Diverters</li><li>Endosaccular Disruptors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cerebral flow diverter market consists of devices that redirect blood flow away from an aneurysm, promoting aneurysm occlusion and preserving surrounding brain tissue. In contrast, endosaccular disruptors are used to directly target and occlude aneurysms from within, often via embolization. Both market types focus on treating cerebral aneurysms but employ different mechanisms: flow diverters modify blood flow patterns, while disruptors disrupt the aneurysm sac, offering options for neurosurgeons based on specific patient needs.</p></p>
