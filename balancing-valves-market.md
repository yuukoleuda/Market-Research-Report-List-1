<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Balancing Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Manual Balancing Valves</li><li>Automatic Balancing Valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The balancing valves market encompasses two main types: manual and automatic balancing valves. Manual balancing valves require users to adjust flow rates manually, ensuring optimal performance in HVAC systems. They are often used in smaller installations where specific adjustments are manageable. In contrast, automatic balancing valves self-regulate flow based on pressure changes, providing consistent performance without manual intervention. This makes them ideal for larger, complex systems, improving efficiency and reducing energy consumption while minimizing the need for ongoing adjustments.</p></p>
