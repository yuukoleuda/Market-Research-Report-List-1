<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Data Center Liquid Immersion Cooling Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Phase Cooling</li><li>Two Phase Cooling</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Data Center Liquid Immersion Cooling comprises two main types: Single Phase and Two Phase Cooling. Single Phase Cooling involves immersing servers in a non-conductive liquid that absorbs heat, keeping components cool without phase change, making it simple and efficient. In contrast, Two Phase Cooling utilizes a liquid that turns into vapor when heated, absorbing more heat effectively before condensing back into liquid. This method offers superior thermal management, allowing for higher density computing and energy efficiency in data centers.</p></p>
