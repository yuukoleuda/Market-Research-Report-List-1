<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Lidar Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solid State LiDAR</li><li>Mechanical LiDAR</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive lidar sensors market is primarily divided into two types: solid-state LiDAR and mechanical LiDAR. Solid-state LiDAR utilizes a fixed arrangement of sensors and lacks moving parts, making it compact, reliable, and well-suited for integration into vehicles. In contrast, mechanical LiDAR employs rotating components to capture a 360-degree view, providing high-resolution mapping but may be bulkier and more sensitive to wear. Both types play crucial roles in enabling advanced driver-assistance systems and autonomous vehicle technologies.</p></p>
